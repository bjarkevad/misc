misc
====

Assorted bits and pieces of code. This repository contains several
bits of code that aren't projects in their own right. The idea is
just to have somewhere to keep miscellaneous code fragments that
may or may not be useful.

Some of these things stem from attempts to reproduce features of
better known libraries (e.g. the Boost C++ libraries). Others are
my attempts to learn programming languages. Still others are just
there for fun, and serve no useful purpose whatsoever.

Many of these fragments have been sat on my external hard drive for
years; the idea behind putting them on github is to make them
available in case I ever wanted to use (or look at) them.
